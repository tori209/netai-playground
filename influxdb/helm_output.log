NAME: influxdb
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu May  1 08:02:51 2025
NAMESPACE: influxdb
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
InfluxDB 2 is deployed as a StatefulSet on your cluster.

You can access it by using the service name: influxdb-influxdb2

To retrieve the password for the 'admin' user:

  echo $(kubectl get secret influxdb-influxdb2-auth -o "jsonpath={.data['admin-password']}" --namespace influxdb | base64 --decode)

Note: with enabled persistence, admin password is only set once during the initial deployment. The password is not changed when InfluxDB 2 is re-deployed with different password.
